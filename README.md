# Potato_Leaf_Disease_classification_Using_CNN
This project was developed to identity major potato leaf diseases using a website
Developed a robust deep learning model using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
for accurate classification of potato leaf diseases.
Implemented a data augmentation, TensorFlow input pipeline to enhance the training
dataset and improve model generalization.
Utilized TensorFlow Serving and FASTAPI to deploy the model as a RESTful API backend
for seamless inference.
Created an intuitive user interface using React.js for the frontend to provide a user friendly experience.
